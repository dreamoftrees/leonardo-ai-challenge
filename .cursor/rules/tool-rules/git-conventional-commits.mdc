To enhance the guidelines for crafting Git commit messages that adhere to the Conventional Commits specification, consider the following best practices:

## Use the Imperative Mood

Write commit messages in the imperative tense, as if giving a command. For example, use “fix bug” instead of “fixed bug” or “fixes bug”. This convention aligns with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert, promoting consistency and clarity.  ￼

## Structure of the Commit Message:

- Header: Consists of a type, an optional scope, and a concise description. ￼
- Type: Indicates the nature of the change, such as:
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - chore: Routine tasks or maintenance
  - docs: Documentation updates
  - style: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - perf: Performance improvements
  - test: Adding or updating tests
  - build: Changes affecting the build system or dependencies
  - ci: Continuous Integration related changes
- Scope: Optional context specifying the section of the codebase affected (e.g., auth, api, ui).
- Description: A brief summary of the change, ideally under 50 characters.
- Body (Optional): Provides a more detailed explanation of the commit, including the motivation for the change and its context.
- Footer (Optional): Includes references to issues, breaking changes, or other metadata. ￼

### Example:

```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication

- Implement JWT authentication for secure API access
- Update login and signup endpoints to issue tokens
- Add middleware to validate tokens on protected routes
```

## Keep Messages Concise

The header should be concise, typically not exceeding 50 characters. This brevity ensures readability in various Git tools and logs.

## Separate Subject from Body

If providing a detailed description, separate the subject line from the body with a blank line. This separation enhances clarity and formatting.  ￼

## Reference Issues and Pull Requests

When applicable, include references to related issues or pull requests in the footer. This practice creates traceability and context for the changes.  ￼

## Use Active Voice

Employ active voice to make commit messages more direct and engaging. For example, “add feature” is preferable to “feature added”.  ￼

## Automate Enforcement

Utilize tools like Git hooks or commit linting utilities to enforce commit message conventions automatically. This automation helps maintain consistency across the team.  ￼

By integrating these best practices, commit messages will be more structured, informative, and aligned with the Conventional Commits specification, thereby enhancing collaboration and project maintainability.
